# Front End Nanodegree Arcade Game #

## Introduction
This Arcade Game is a Classic Arcade Game Clone meant to test my javascript skills

## How to play ##

### Goal ###
The goal is to move the little pink haired girl from the grass to the water, avoiding the bad bugs crossing the way.

### Gameplay ###
By using the arrows of your keyboard, you will be able to move the little girl right/down/left/top. 

### How to win ###
Each time the little girl reaches the water, you score 1 point. But be careful, being touched by a bug removes 1 point.

You will win the game if you are able to lead the little girl safely to the water and score 5 points.
